# Introduction

The Home finder system is a website where :
  - users can enter keywords such as location and type of housing in a search bar,\
    and in turn they get search results displaying available homes on sale.
  - Users can set search filters to customize their search results.

Administrators on the other hand can ;
  - Perform database manipulation. (Add, remove, lookup, modify properties on sale)

However, this website does not offer :
  - Payment services between home buyers and sellers.
  - Communication services between buyers and sellers.

We can just say, this is a home-display application.
